### **Step 1: Fork the repository**

* Go to the GitHub page of the project.
* Click **Fork** → this creates a copy under your GitHub account.

---

### **Step 2: Clone your fork**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project.git
cd project
```

---

### **Step 3: Create a feature branch**

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

* Never work directly on `main` in an open source project.
* Add your changes/feature here.

---

### **Step 4: Commit your changes**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add my feature"
```

---

### **Step 5: Push your feature branch to your fork**

```bash
git push origin feature-branch
```

* This pushes your branch to **your GitHub fork**, not the original repository.

---

### **Step 6: Create a Pull Request (PR)**

1. Go to your fork on GitHub.
2. You’ll see a **“Compare & pull request”** button.
3. Select the original repository as the target (`base` = original main, `compare` = your feature branch).
4. Add a title + description explaining your feature.
5. Click **Create Pull Request**.

* Now the maintainers of the original repo can **review your changes** and merge them.

---

### ✅ Key Points

* **Do NOT push directly** to the original repo unless you have write access.
* Always work on a **separate feature branch**.
* Use **pull requests** to propose changes.
