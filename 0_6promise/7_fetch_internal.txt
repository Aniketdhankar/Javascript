## 🟢 **Part 1: Network Promise (Top Browser Level)**

* When you call `fetch(url)`, the browser **sends the request over the network**.
* This is the **first Promise** — it represents the **network request itself**.
* The Promise will **resolve** when the **HTTP response headers** come back from the server (status, headers, etc.).
* Or it will **reject** if there’s a **network error** (e.g., no internet).
* At this point, **the body hasn’t been read yet** — the response is still on the browser side.

**Think of it like:**

> “The parcel has arrived at your doorstep” — you know it’s there, but haven’t opened it yet.

## 🔵 **Part 2: Data Promise (Memory / Parsing Level)**

* Once you call `response.json()` (or `response.text()`, etc.), you are **reading the body** of the response into memory.
* This is the **second Promise** — it represents **parsing the data**.
* The Promise resolves with the **actual usable data** (JavaScript object) or rejects if parsing fails.

**Think of it like:**

> “You opened the parcel and now can use what’s inside.”

### 🔁 How Both Work Together

```text
fetch()  →  Network Promise (resolve with Response)  
          ↓
response.json() → Memory/Data Promise (resolve with data object)
```

* **Top-level network Promise** handles **delivery** (fulfilled/rejected).
* **Memory/data Promise** handles **reading/parsing** (fulfilled/rejected).

So your teacher’s “top browser → memory” explanation is exactly this **two-stage process**:

1. Browser/network layer checks if response is received.
2. Memory layer parses the body into actual usable data.

### 🧩 Analogy

* **Part 1 (browser)** → parcel arrives at your house (network check).
* **Part 2 (memory)** → you open the parcel and take items out (parse to JSON).
