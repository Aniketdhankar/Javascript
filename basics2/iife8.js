/*
ðŸ’¡ What is Global Scope Pollution?

In JavaScript, variables declared outside any function are global.

If too many scripts or variables share the global space, they can overwrite each other, causing bugs.

This problem is called global scope pollution.

ðŸ”¹ Example
// Script 1
var user = "Aniket";
console.log(user); // Aniket

// Script 2 (loaded later)
var user = "Ravi"; // accidentally overwrites previous global variable
console.log(user); // Ravi
*/


//n IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a function that runs as soon as it is defined.
//It creates a private scope, so variables inside it do not pollute the global scope.
//This helps prevent name conflicts and bugs in large projects or when using multiple scripts.
//Before let and const were common, IIFEs were widely used to encapsulate code.
//Syntax example: (function() { /* code */ })(); runs immediately and keeps variables local.
