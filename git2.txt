```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git fetch origin branch4
git rebase origin/branch4
```

Here‚Äôs what happens **and why this isn‚Äôt exactly what you want**:

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ `git checkout main`**

* Switches to the `main` branch ‚úÖ

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ `git pull origin main`**

* Updates your local `main` with all changes from remote `main` ‚úÖ

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ `git fetch origin branch4`**

* Fetches the remote `branch4` commits, but does **not** apply them yet ‚úÖ

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ `git rebase origin/branch4`**

* This will **replay your local `main` commits on top of `branch4`**, which is **the opposite of what you want**.
* You wanted `branch4`‚Äôs feature **added to main**, not `main`‚Äôs commits moved onto branch4.

---

### ‚úÖ Correct way to merge `branch4` into `main`

#### Option 1: **Merge (safer, keeps history)**

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main       # update main
git fetch origin branch4   # get latest branch4 commits
git merge origin/branch4   # merge branch4 into main
git push origin main       # push updated main to remote
```

* This creates a **merge commit** that combines main + branch4.
* Conflicts (if any) need to be resolved manually.

#### Option 2: **Rebase branch4 onto main (linear history)**

```bash
git checkout branch4
git fetch origin main      # get latest main
git rebase origin/main     # rebase branch4 commits on top of main
git checkout main
git merge branch4          # fast-forward merge into main
git push origin main
```

* This keeps history **linear** ‚Äî main branch looks like the branch4 commits happened on top of main.
* Avoids a merge commit.

---

üí° **Summary:**

* **Merging**: Simple, safer, keeps all branch history.
* **Rebasing**: Cleaner linear history, but rewrites commits (careful if branch4 is shared).
