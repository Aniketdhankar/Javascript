in older version only master was created but newer git version creates two git master and main  and main is the default

## ðŸ§­ Full Steps: Moving from `master` to `main`

### **Step 1: Start with master branch**

When you initialized your repo (or cloned it), you had:

```bash
git init   # or cloned repo
git branch
# Output:
# * master
```

So initially, your **only branch is `master`**.

---

### **Step 2: Commit all your changes in master**

Add all files and commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit on master"
```

âœ… Now your `master` branch contains all your work.

---

### **Step 3: Create a new branch `main` from master**

```bash
git checkout -b main master

-b option

The -b flag tells Git to create a new branch and switch to it immediately.

So git checkout -b <new-branch> = create branch + switch to it
```

* This **creates the `main` branch** and switches to it.
* `main` now has all commits from `master`.



master

This tells Git the starting point for the new branch.

In other words, main will start with all the commits that currently exist in master.

If you omit this, Git uses your current branch as the base.

---

### **Step 4: Push `main` branch to remote**

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

* `-u` sets the upstream, so future `git push`/`pull` work automatically.
* Remote now has a `main` branch with all your code.

---

### **Step 5: (Optional) Set `main` as the default branch on GitHub**

1. Go to your repository â†’ **Settings â†’ Branches**
2. Change **Default branch** from `master` â†’ `main`
3. Save changes.

---

### **Step 6: (Optional) Delete the old `master` branch from remote**

```bash
git push origin --delete master
```

* Removes the old `master` branch from the remote.
* Now `main` is your only active branch.
